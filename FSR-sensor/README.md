# FSR-sensor
Force Sensor Resistor, it detects physical pressure which changes its resistance when a force or pressure is applied. The higher the pressure, more conductive material will contact to the wires

## FSR information

- FSR 402
-** Active part:** 12,7mm
- **Sensitivity:** 0.1N a 10.0Â²N


## Circuit
The sensor has two pins, the right and the left one.

**1. LEFT PIN:**
- We're going to connect only to the CVV (5V) -- red cable 


**2. RIGHT PIN:**
- First, we're going to get a 10kohm resistor and put one of its pin here and the other on a free spot inside the breadboard


**3. CONNECTIONS WITH THE RESISTOR:**
- Above the resistor, we're going to connect on the analog input on the Arduino -- blue cable
- Under the resistor, we're goin to connect to the GND (ground) -- black cable
